The solution contains 2 components
 - Task Entity
	- Updated the default main form.
 - Canvas App
	- Tasks Timeline

To view the timeline in action:
1. Open the D365 Custom App
2. Select an account
3. Add a few tasks to an account
4. Use the Task form to change the status reason in the tasks you added.
5. Navigate to power Apps and Open the Tasks Timeline
6. Select the account you added the tasks to.

Known issues
- When you select an account you will get a form notification(error) on the canvas app. This is because of a formula on Gallery3. 
It does not in any way interfere with the intent of the demo: How do I configure data in D365 as a timeline without any custom component.
